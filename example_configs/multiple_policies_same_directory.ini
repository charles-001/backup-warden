# Example configuration for applying multiple retention policies to different
# file patterns within the same directory
#
# This is useful when you have different types of backups (e.g., full and
# incremental backups) in the same location and want to apply different
# retention rules to each type.
#
# Use case: Database backups with both full and incremental backups
# Directory: /path/to/backup/
#   - full-2024-01-01.zip (full backup)
#   - full-2024-01-02.zip (full backup)
#   - inc-2024-01-01.zip (incremental backup)
#   - inc-2024-01-02.zip (incremental backup)

[main]
path = /path/to/backup
source = local

# Full backup retention policy
# Keep full backups longer since they're needed to restore incrementals
[/path/to/backup/full*]
daily = 7
weekly = 4
monthly = 12
yearly = always
include_list = *full*

# Incremental backup retention policy
# Keep fewer incremental backups since they depend on full backups
[/path/to/backup/inc*]
daily = 3
include_list = *inc*

# IMPORTANT: The include_list option is critical!
# Without it, only one policy would be applied to all backups in the directory.
# The include_list filter ensures each policy processes only its intended files.
